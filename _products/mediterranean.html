Mediterranean cuisine is the food from the lands around the Mediterranean Sea and its preparation. This geographical area broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree, which provides one of the most distinctive features of the region's cooking, olive oil. Although this region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines, the historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that there are common elements in these cuisines, which include Italian, Levantine, Maghrebi, Ottoman, Proven√ßal (French), and Spanish cuisines.
